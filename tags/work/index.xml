      <description>Working more than 6 years as Software Engineer I really started to appreciate the three C&amp;rsquo;s rule of career development. Any job must have at least two of the three C&amp;rsquo;s:
 Contacts which will help you to find your next engagement. Content, i.e. an exciting project that will improve your skills and will be challenging to do. Cash, i.e. a rate of pay that will makes you smile rather than resent your employer or hardly think about money in the middle of the month.</description>
