Hi there.  It's nice to see you on my personal blog!

### Short bio

My name is Andrey Krisanov and I'm a Software Engineer with several years of expirience in full-stack application development, DevOps and team management.

Currently work mostly on backends in **Go** and **Ruby on Rails**.
Excited about TypeScript, React, **React Native**.
Interested in **distributed systems** and functional programming.
Can design, implement and maintain product infrastructure running on the cloud.
[CV (Resume)](/cv/)

### Continuous learning

I'm really passionate about continuous learning.
Trying to learn something new everyday and apply it in daily work.

### Right tool for the job

I would say I'm a polyglot programmer and not stick on some language or technology stack. Before any project implementation I do analysis and choose "the right tool for the job". My preference are:

* Node.js (with TypeScript) || Ruby on Rails for quick prototyping and small web apps or API;
* Go (Golang) when I have to care about performance, data processing, concurrency and so on;
* PostgreSQL as a primary database;
* React, Redux on the frontend side;
* React Native for mobile apps (I came to it from "native world" and happy with the Facebook approach);
* Docker, Circle CI for continuous integration and delivery;
* AWS for application hosting and scaling (experimenting with Azure, Google Cloud);
* _Clojure / F# / C# (.NET Core)_ for inspiration.
