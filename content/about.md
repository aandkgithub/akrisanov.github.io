Hi :)

### Short bio

I am a Software Engineer with several years of expirience in full-stack development.

Currently work mostly on backends in **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails**, but want to switch the stack in the near future - **please reach me out if you have an interesting opportunity**.
In that case, Iâ€™m experienced with **full stack** **JavaScript (ES6/7)**, **TypeScript** and **Go**.
Can design, implement and maintain product infrastructure running on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
Also, interested in functional programming (Clojure/F#), **distributed systems**, and **machine learning**.

### Right tool for the job

I prefer to use:

* Node.js + Swagger for implementing API and quick prototyping.
* Go (Golang) when I have to care about performance, data processing, concurrency and so on.
* PostgreSQL as a primary database.
* React, Redux on the frontend side.
* React Native for mobile apps (I came to it from "native world" and happy with the Facebook approach).
* Docker, Circle CI for continuous integration and delivery.
* AWS for application hosting and scaling (experimenting with Azure, Google Cloud).

### Continuous learning

I'm really passionate about continuous learning.
Trying to learn something new everyday and apply it in daily work.
