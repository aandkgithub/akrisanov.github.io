Hi :)

### Short bio

I am a Software Engineer with several years of expirience in full-stack development.

Mainly work on backends in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but want to switch the stack in the near future - **please reach me out if you have an interesting opportunity** :) In that case, Iâ€™m experienced with JavaScript (ES6/7), TypeScript, React and React Native, Node.js. Can design, implement and maintain product infrastructure running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, interested in distributed systems, and machine learning.

### Right tool for the job

I prefer to use:

* Node.js + Swagger for implementing API and prototyping
* .NET Core, F# or Go when I have to care about performance, concurrency and so on.
* PostgreSQL as a primary database
* React.js on frontend side
* React Native for mobile apps (I came to it from "native world" and happy with the Facebook approach)
* Docker, Circle CI for continuous integration and delivery
* AWS for application hosting and scaling (experimenting with Azure, but doesn't stick with it yet)

### Continuous learning

I'm really passionate about continuous learning. Trying to learn something new everyday and apply it in daily work.
Beside all described above languages and technologies, I'm curious about:

* Functional programming
* Data structures and algorithms
* Math
