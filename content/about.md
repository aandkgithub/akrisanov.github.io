Hi there.  It's nice to see you on my personal blog!

### Short bio

My name is Andrey Krisanov and I'm a Software Engineer with several years of expirience in full-stack application development, DevOps and team management.

Iâ€™m a polyglot programmer and don't stick with some language or technology stack.
It's more important to me to focus on the product development and delivery.
At the moment I work on backends in **Go**, **Clojure**, and **Ruby**.

I'm interested in distributed systems, data engineering, and functional programming.
The modern frontend development is a horror movie for me :)
But, thanks, **ClojureScript**, **React**, **React Native** for saving me there.

### Continuous learning

I'm really passionate about continuous learning.
Trying to learn something new everyday and apply it in daily work.

### Right tool for the job

Before any project implementation I do analysis and pick "the right tool for the job".
My preference are:

* Ruby for quick prototyping and small web apps or API;
* Go (Golang) or Clojure/JVM when I have to care about performance, data processing, concurrency and so on;
* PostgreSQL as a primary database;
* React, Vue on the frontend side;
* React Native for mobile apps (I came to it from "native world" and happy with the Facebook approach);
* Docker, Circle CI for continuous integration and delivery;
* AWS for application hosting and scaling (experimenting with Azure, Google Cloud).
